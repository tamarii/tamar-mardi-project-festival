                No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It
                belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses who
                offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi
                Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for
                vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not
                know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the
                government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is
                responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the
                country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras
                celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day
                (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however,
                is on a different day each year. Fat Tuesday changes every year
                because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday. Most visitors
                plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras
                day and stay through Ash Wednesday.

                The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very
                warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to
                the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your
                clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.
                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable
                shoes and clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to
                check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then
                you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New
                Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and
                Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down
                the streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day
                Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer
                than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also
                great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big
                parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras
                festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the
                French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes and masks is a
                unique and thrilling experience.

                By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is
                a family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans
                feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue
                going to every parade because we used to use "taking the
                children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage
                bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often
                include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more. The only place
                you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no
                full-size parades pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades
                when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since
                parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The
                Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where
                you will see many families staking out their parade watching
                position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the
                beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the
                streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
                You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in
                suburban areas like Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from
                New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi
                Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras
                day. Kids love it!

                The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on
                Super Sunday (generally the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s Day
                in March). The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere,
                but they happen in and around their inner-city neighborhoods.
                Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at
                the corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m.
                and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet
                at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu
                parade. The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has
                their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of March, around St.
                Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis
                Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras
                Indians once again dress in their feathers and suits, and take
                to the streets to meet other "gangs." For the Indian Sunday
                parade route, visit our Super Sunday page. Also, the Tambourine
                and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday"
                parade on the Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event
                beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been yet
                a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April
                during the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz
                Fest. No specific details are available on these events at this
                time.

                During Mardi Gras parades, seats aren’t a necessity. Most people
                at the parades will be standing or even jumping for throws—and
                in between parades, people are walking around and popping into
                local restaurants for a bite. However, we recommend Grandstands
                for people who may have trouble standing or walking for longer
                than an hour at a time.

                There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is
                no single organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade
                krewe decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept
                secret until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their
                throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have
                one) reflect this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic
                themes were popular. Most of the krewes are named after figures
                from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are named
                after the neighborhood where they parade.

                parade where sponsors can participate. These include Zulu’s

                Even though every parade is unique, Orpheus, Bacchus, and
                Endymion feature the most intricate, massive, and extravagant
                floats. According to Wikipedia, “While there is no official
                definition for "super Krewe,” it is generally accepted that a
                super krewe possesses over 1,000 active dues-paying members and
                maintains at least 500 riders for its parade each carnival.”
                Here at MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, we think there’s a little more
                to it than that. Along with a large membership, super krewes
                have huge, double- and triple-decker floats, much sought-after
                signature throws, and celebrity monarchs. They also are known
                for their big before and after-parade celebrations with big-name
                talent (i.e., the Bacchus Bash, the Endymion Extravaganza, and
                the Orpheuscapade). The first super krewe was Bacchus, founded
                in 1968. While founded in 1967, Endymion emerged as a super
                krewe in 1974. Orpheus, founded in 1993, also enjoys super krewe
                status. Three all-female super krewes also take to the parade
                route, including the Krewe of Muses and the Krewe of Nyx. With
                1,600+ active riders, the Krewe of Iris, established in 1917, is
                not only the largest female Mardi Gras krewe, but it is also the
                oldest. Click on the krewe names to learn more about each krewe.

                After a few floats, you may have so many beads around your neck,
                you’ll need a place to put them! Be sure to bring a bag to store
